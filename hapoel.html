            The Head Coach of the Hapoel Jerusalem Soccer Team has hours and
            hours of game footage to scour through and needs to quickly identify trends
            that lead to team success. My boss, the Head of Data Analytics,
            tasked me with summarizing all the data into the game's most crucial
            moments; an exercise in moving from data processing to data
            visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was provided with a sample XML file, unique to a particular game, consisting
            of all the data from every single play, including the smallest
            details of who passed the ball to whom, where on the field, and at
            what time of the game. I created a Python script that parsed this
            data, stored it all in a Pandas dataframe, and converted it into graphs
            depicting all the team's shots on goal, as seen in the diagrams
            below. My experience with string and array manipulation helped me
            organize the data for my needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I color coded each line on the graph to reflect a dribble, pass, and
            shot, respectively, created a legend that documented the chronology
            of plays within the possession, and added a title that described the
            moment, including who shot the ball, the time elapsed, and the
            result of the play. Now, the head coach can upload an XML file to my
            script and have all the important moments of the game to analyze
            within seconds. He can then identify trends and patterns for team
            success and make decisions more efficiently.
