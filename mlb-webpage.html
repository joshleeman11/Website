        <h4>Redesigned MLB Webpage</h4>

        <p>
            As a Software Engineer Intern on MLB's Data Platform team, our goal
            was to ensure the data that fans see on popular websites, like
            MLB.com, accurately updated constantly. Typically, data is kept in a
            computer's cache if we want it to reload immediately. The downside
            is that data can't be updated while it is in the cache.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what happens when a player hits a home run and his stats need to
            be updated immediately? My job surrounded an internal website that
            was responsible for clearing data from the cache when it needed to
            be updated.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was tasked with redesigning this website to make it more
            user-friendly and allow employees to clear a robust amount data from
            the cache more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used HTML, Javascript, and React to implement the numerous
            features, as seen below in the video and screenshots. HTML helped me
            organize the page into 'Required' and 'Optional' parameters that
            previously hadn't existed before. It also helped me highlight
            incorrectly inputted text fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I used Javascript to validate all user input.
            Specifically, I used certain libraries and other internal MLB APIs
            to check whether a certain sportId or leagueId, for example, matched
            a currently existing one. I also used Javascript to code a file
            upload feature that parsed an uploaded excel file with data to be
            submitted all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, I used React to track the state of the page in order to
            notify the user of any missing required parameters and disabled the
            'Submit' button accordingly to prevent any invalid submissions.
