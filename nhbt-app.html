            The National Hillel Basketball Tournament (NHBT) App is your
            one-stop-shop for all the action throughout the tournament. You can
            track live game updates, standings, brackets, schedules, player and
            team information, and statistics. My teammate and I are proud to say
            that, in March 2024, over 1000 players, fans, and family from across the country
            enjoyed the NHBT App over the course of the weekend tournament.

            We used Flutter to build our app for iOS and Android users and its
            Dart language to code our front-end user interface. We then
            integrated our front-end with our back-end Firebase database to
            share all the live information with our users. In addition to the
            full-stack logic that was required to build our app, one of the
            biggest lessons I learned was the importance of communication
            between organizational teams in delivering the best product. We were
            in constant communication with the game operations team to ensure
            our app's features aligned with the tournament rules. For example,
            we needed to know how many teams there would be in each tier of
            standings. We also had to know how many men and women tiers there would
            be. Lastly, we had to confirm the games would consist of halves
            rather than quarters and which games would track assists and
            rebounds, in addition to points and fouls.
